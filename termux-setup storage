Problem description
My Android is running on CUSTOM ROM RR Nougat 7.1.2. I have allowed storage permission to termux but when I try to execute the command termux-setup-storage, I get this -> CANNOT LINK EXECUTABLE "/system/bin/app_process": cannot locate symbol "__xlog_buf_printf" referenced by "/system/lib/libdpframework.so"...

Steps to reproduce
$termux-setup storage
Expected behavior
I wanted it to allow me to access my internal and external storage from termux but I couldn't
