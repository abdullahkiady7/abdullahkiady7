Sqmlap is a tool that comes with Kali Linux that automates the detection and exploitation of SQL injection security holes. This documentation will describe the process of attacking a number of websites. 
The command sqlmap -u URL was used to test web pages for vulnerabilities. For example:
sqlmap -u http://www.biohack.inn650/?page_id=31

Web pages were also tested manually by using a single ‘ after the web address. For example:
http://www.biohack.inn650/?page_id=31’

Fields in web forms were tested manually. SQL statements were entered into web forms in the hope that output indicating a vulnerability would be returned. Statements used to test for vulnerabilities are presented below:

' OR 1=1

‘OR WHERE pwd LIKE ‘
